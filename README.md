# Lead-Gen Rome

Find small Rome businesses with bad or missing websites, build them a free
demo, sell it for €500 + optional monthly hosting/social retainer.

## Structure

- **`template/`** — the reusable site: single page, mobile-first, sections
  for hero, about, menu/services, gallery, contact, hours, map, socials.
  Plain HTML/CSS/JS, zero build step. Nearly all customization happens in
  one file: `template/js/config.js`.
- **`clients/`** — one folder per business, each a clone of `template/`.
- **`scripts/`** — lead-finding (`find_leads.py`) and deploy helpers
  (`new_client.sh`, `deploy.md`, `pitch_template.md`).

## Workflow

1. `python scripts/find_leads.py "<business type>" --area "<neighborhood>, Roma"`
   → appends candidates to `scripts/leads.csv`.
2. Pick a lead with a missing/bad website, eyeball it.
3. `./scripts/new_client.sh <business-slug>` → scaffolds `clients/<business-slug>/`.
4. Edit `clients/<business-slug>/js/config.js`, drop in real photos.
5. Deploy (`scripts/deploy.md` — Cloudflare Pages or Vercel, both free,
   both instant since there's no build step).
6. Send the demo link (`scripts/pitch_template.md`).
7. Track status in `clients/<business-slug>/_lead.md`.

## Why no framework

The whole point is speed from "found a lead" to "demo is live." Plain
HTML/CSS/JS with one config file means: no `npm install`, no build step, no
dependency rot six months from now, and any static host (Vercel,
Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages) deploys it by just uploading the folder.
